# üê¶ TwitterX Contracts
Smart contracts for TwitterX, the decentralized Twitter frontend.

TwitterX leverages OpenZeppelin's battlested implementation of ERC 1155, with the ability to update the URI of the NFT, allowing the NFT to be evolutive and update over time by changing the URI.

The URI is a simple IPFS link, where all the tweet's data is stored in a decentralized way.

### Made to fork
TwitterX's license is the MIT License, meaning anyone can fork it as long as they give us credit. We encourage forking, which is also why everything is open-source: our contracts, user interface, etc.

The contracts are also [verified on Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x79048c57f1f04febaf453be8cccd6c4cd64ef709#code) to make it easier to interact with them, understand them, with the hopes of making it easier to fork them later on.

Fork it!
